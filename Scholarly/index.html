            <h2>Summary</h2>
			 <p>
				<strong>StoW (Stories on the Web)</strong> is a web application that offers children of all ages a friendly graphical interface
				for reading their favourite stories. The users will be able to search for
				their favorite story on the site (with or without login) and will be able to read and interact with the storyline in a nice way.<br>
				By logging in, the users will be able to upload their own stories and use features such as: leaving a bookmark, adding the story to favourites, rating stories and discussing them with other users. The application will respect the principles of responsive design.
            </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Offering a pleasant and interactive narrative experience via an user-friendly interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					Offering a way of storing and managing an ever-growing collection of stories.
				</li>
				<li>
					Offering our users the possibility of adding new stories and expanding our universe.
				</li>
				<li>
					Offering our users stories tailored to their own needs, based on their age and preferred genres.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			StoW is destined for children, making them our main demographic, but their parents are also a target audience of our application.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>How to use the application:</strong>
				After entering the web page's URL in the browser's adress bar, there are multiple options:
			</p>

			<p><strong>The Menu</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The "Home" button in the upper left side will take you to the homepage of our app.
				</li>
				<li>
					Right next to it, the "Browse" button will take you to the browse view.
				</li>
				<li>
					The "Upload" button allows an user to upload new stories (in an XML format). This feature will require the user to log in.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can search for a specific story by entering its name in the "Search" bar. This will also take you to the browse view.
				</li>
				<li>
					The "Sign in" button on the upper right will take the user to a sign in/register view.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>The Homepage View:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This is the view that the user will face when first starting the application.
				</li>
				<li>
					The user will be greeted with a colourful banner, with two buttons - upload and browse.
					Those buttons can also be found in the menu on the top, among other tools useful for navigating the website.
				</li>
				<li>
					Below the banner are listed a few of the most recently added stories.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>The Browse View:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This is the interface that allows the user to navigate through our stories, and find something worth a read.
				</li>
				<li>
					The user can filter the stories by age or by genre. Or use the search function to find something specific.
				</li>
				<li>
					The resulting array of stories can be navigated via the "next" and "previous" buttons.
				</li>
				<li>
					On hovering, the covers of the displayed stories will reveal more information about them, such as title and user rating.
				</li>
				<li>
					To open a story the user has to click on the cover of the prefered book.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>The Story View:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Here, the user can read the story he/she wants. By clicking next, the next page of the story will be loaded.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the story is interactive, instead of a next button, there will be a list of options. The reader then has to decide how the story continues.
				</li>
				<li>
					At the bottom, the progress bar is shown, indicating how much the user has already read.
				</li>
				<li>
					The "A+" and "A-" buttons will zoom the text in and out.
				</li>
				<li>
					A bookmark can be placed on the page by clicking the icon on the left side, so that the next time the user logs in, he/she can continue from where he/she left off.
				</li>
				<li>
					The story can be rated with 1 to 5 stars and can be added to favorites by clicking
					the "heart" icon.
				</li>

			</ul>

		<h2><strong>Progress</strong></h2>
		<p id="centerIt"><em>This isn't even my final form!</em></p>

		<hr>

		<h2>The backend</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Compiled a list of features that the final product should have (use cases).	
			</li>
			<li>
				Sketched the database architecture: The content of the stories will be structured in a linked list of "blocks" (where a block could have links to multiple other blocks - to support interaction with the reader) which will be stored in a separate table of the database.
			</li>
			<li>
				Conceived the XML format that will be used to upload stories to the database (and perhaps in the future export stories from the database).
			</li>
			<li>
				Changed the architecture so that the content will be kept in external XML files instead (the database will only hold links to those). We gave up on the concept of "blocks" because we deemed them to not be flexible enough (for example, adding images would be hard).
			</li>
			<li>
				Created a DTD file to properly define the XML format.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added support for special user types (for now only "admins" were added, but with the possibility to easily add more later on).
			</li>
			<li>
				Overhauled the way story categories work: Previously they would be very limited; a story could only have one age group and one genre. Now it's possible for a story to fall into multiple categories, and it should also be easy to add new kinds of categories in teh future.
			</li>
			<li>
				Slightly modified the XML format to accomodate new category system.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added support for favourites, comments, ratings and bookmarks. All of those features will be modeled as associative tables between "Users" and "Stories".
			</li>
			<li>
				Made UML diagrams for use cases and components.
			</li>
			
		</ul>

		    <ul>
		      <li>
		        Chose the color scheme and the fonts to create a childish mood and a simple, clean look.
		      </li>
		      <li>
		      	Browsed the web for "children's books" images. Credit goes to <a href="freepik.com">freepik.com</a> for all the beautifully designed, flat-style images that are free to use for personal or commercial purpose as long as credit is given.
		      </li>
		      <li>
		        Wrote the website's description.
		      </li>
		      <li>
		        Created the general layout of the website: menu, title, description, useful buttons, useful content (recently added) and footer. The menu contains the following pages: the home page, the browse page and the upload page for power-users on the left and sign in/register options + the search function on the right.
		      </li>
		    </ul>

		      Decided to place the filters on the left (age group, genre) and the ordering on top of the results. The user can deselect filters, not just add them. Anyone can have access to the "Browse" page, no account is necessary.

			      Decided to place the title, author, rating and comment + favourite buttons on the same section. Only registered users can rate, comment and favourite.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			      Placed the bookmark on the "edge" of the book-page (that has 2 pages). Only registered users can bookmark their progress.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			      Placed the dummy text in 2 pages (that can also be 2 images or an image and a page of text).
			    </li>
			    <li>
			      Added accesibility function: text sise increase buttons.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			      Added the option to go to the next page and to go back.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			      Added the progress bar.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			      Designed the "more than one next page" option for interactive storytelling. The user has to make a decision to continue the story.

			<h2>ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF STOW</h2>
		    <figure typeof="sa:Image">
		      <img src="imgFinal/home.png">
		      <figcaption>
		        This is how the home page looks.
		      </figcaption>
		    </figure>
		    
		    <p>
		      On the home page you can see: "Browse", "Upload", "Search", "Account" buttons and the recently added stories.
		    </p>

		   <li>
		   	Tehnical details:
		   </li>

		   <p>
		   		In the home page, in order to populate the most recently added 5 stories we make a request to the server that will query the database and will return the title, rating, authors and the json in which every story keeps its content (paths to images and text), in order to populate the thumbnails for every story.

		   </p>

		   <li>Front-end:</li>
		   <p>
		   	The whole page has a maximum width of the content of 960px to ensure good reading on monitors of any size without straining the eyes. Resizing the window to a smaller size will not make the content unreadable. There is also a mobile version that "activates" when the browser window has a width of 500px or lower. In order to make this website flexible, flex-box was used. The menu is fixed and always will be present at the top of the page, no matter how far down you scroll.
		   </p>

		   <figure typeof="sa:Image">
		      <img src="imgFinal/mobile_home.png">

		        Mobile view: the home page.
		      </figcaption>
		    </figure>
		    
		    <p>
		       The mobile version is very similar to the desktop version and it's easy to navigate through it.
		    </p>

		    <figure typeof="sa:Image">
		      <img src="imgFinal/browse.png">
		      <figcaption>
		        This is the Browse View.
		      </figcaption>
		    </figure>
		    
		    <p>
		      When you press "Browse", you will be presented with a page with filters: "AGE GROUP", "GENRE". You can also order yoUr results after applying filters by seleting either "RATING", "DATE ADDED" or "ALPHABETIC" from the drop down lists. Ordering can be either ascending or descending. On the bottom of the page you can see the pagination section with the buttons: "FIRST", "PREV" ,"NEXT" and "LAST".
		    </p>

		    <li>
		    Tehnical details:
		    </li>
		    <p>
		    	In order to populate with the desired stories, a POST is made to the server with all the filters necessary, or none if the user intended so. When you choose a new filter or want a different ordering or press the next or prev button an AJAX request is made, in order not to reload the page and give a better user experience.You can choose as many filters as you like, they will never duplicate. The server will execute the "Browse.php" controller and give back the result returned by the find function from the "Story.php" model.
		    </p>

		    <figure typeof="sa:Image">
